# coffea
Using JavaFX and advanced data structures, we're going to create a new kind of music player that looks and sounds great.

This project is the independent project of Rahul Deshpande and Siddhant Sharma for the AP CS A class at California High School.

# Objective 
This application is designed with a grandparent or another elderly person in mind. See, many old people feel overwhelmed by features in a modern music player. From Radio, to accounts, to licensing, et cetera, it can get to be a bit much. This is why we created the Coffea player. It sports an intuitive interface designed from the ground up for seniors— large text with high contrast helps a user see elements easier and large buttons allow for easy clicking.
